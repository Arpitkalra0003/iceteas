           </h1> 
           
        <h2 class="txt-orange paragraph-head margin-30 left wow fadeInUp">1. A Large Library Of High-Quality Products</h2>
            
       <p class="paragraph-text left wow fadeInUp">
           As an affiliate you’re looking for <b>a company that carries variety, that gives you options, and that caters to different customers </b>or the many different areas in the lives of your audience – yet has a clear focus and direction on its niche.
        </p>
            
            
            <img src="imgs/inner/aff-mva.jpg" class="padding-left-40 img-inner margin-top-50 above wow fadeInUp">
            
            
            <p class="paragraph-text left wow fadeInUp margin-top-30 wow fadeInUp">
                Mindvalley hosts an online academy that offers many of the hottest personal growth products in the industry. <b>We’ve partnered with outstanding authors and publishers that have chosen to have their products on</b> <a href="http://mindvalleyacademy.com/" target="_blank">Mindvalley Academy</a> – our cutting-edge, high-end learning platform and storefront that currently caters to 1.5 million students.
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph-text left wow fadeInUp margin-top-30 wow fadeInUp">
            When you sign up with us, we keep you updated regularly through emails and blog posts on our Mindvalley Affiliate Blog so that you’re always in the know of upcoming launches and offers.
          </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph-text left wow fadeInUp margin-top-30">
                As an affiliate marketer, you also need to focus on high-quality products – the kind that makes your customers value you and buy from you over and over again. How do we define “high-quality”? With our own customized quality checks. <b>For instance, each product considered goes through a customer survey that poses what strategist Fred Reichheld calls The Ultimate Question:</b>
            <p/>
            
            <h1 class="quote-text left wow fadeInUp">On a scale of 1-to-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to your family, friends and neighbors?
               <br><span>― The Ultimate Question</span>
           </h1> 

           <p class="paragraph-text left margin-top-30 float-left wow fadeInUp">
            Any product that scores less than 8 is dropped from our shelves. So when you’re looking for a valuable and effective affiliate product, ensure that the publisher you’re working with is asking their customers the same question.
           </p> 


           <h2 class="txt-orange paragraph-head margin-30 left wow fadeInUp">2. Solid and Accurate Sign-up and Tracking System</h2>
            
        <p class="paragraph-text left wow fadeInUp">
            <b>We’ve got a sign-up process that’s so simple, you can begin earning commissions right away – without any hoop-jumping.</b> You’ll also get accurate stats on how your promotions are doing. The problem with a lot of publishers is that they use cheap, under-performing affiliate softwares. These softwares are often very confusing or difficult to navigate.
          </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph-text left wow fadeInUp margin-top-30">
            However, our chosen software and platform isn’t! We use CAKE, a user-friendly interface and real-time tracking optimization platform that lets you have your links and check your stats whenever you need to (that’s right – you can have your cake and eat it too).
          </p>


            <h2 class="txt-orange paragraph-head margin-30 left wow fadeInUp">3. High Commissions on Every Product Paid Out on Time</h2>
            
        <p class="paragraph-text left wow fadeInUp">
            You want to work with a company that offers <b>optimal commission rates and still allows room to expand, and that pays on time – everytime</b>.
          </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph-text left wow fadeInUp margin-top-30">
            Mindvalley is able to pay our affiliates 50% for every sale. You can count on receiving your commission payouts after the refund period is over via Paypal. Plus – you’ll earn 50% on all other up-sells. There’s more: as a high-earning affiliate, we reward you when you sell more than others by granting you some extra perks.
          </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph-text left wow fadeInUp margin-top-30">
                Lastly, you want to secure your customer base for as long as you are an affiliate. <b>With the Mindvalley Affiliate program, we provide you with cookies that will last an entire 90 days</b>.
            <br><br>
            We also operate on a last-cookie basis, which means that you can still jump in later in the launch to participate
          </p>
            

            <h2 class="txt-orange paragraph-head margin-30 left wow fadeInUp">4. Extraordinary Customer Service that Wows</h2>

            <p class="paragraph-text left wow fadeInUp margin-top-30">

            <h2 class="txt-orange paragraph-head margin-30 left wow fadeInUp">5. Great Pre-launch and Launch Conversions</h2>
            
            <p class="paragraph-text left wow fadeInUp">

            <h2 class="txt-orange paragraph-head margin-30 left wow fadeInUp">6. Valuable Affiliate Tools</h2>
            
            <p class="paragraph-text left wow fadeInUp">
                When you’re taking part in a launch, the most important thing is to keep your list engaged and active. How do you do that? <b>By giving them great content.</b>
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph-text left wow fadeInUp margin-top-30">
                For every one of our launches, <b>we make sure you have valuable and inspiring content to send to your list</b>. We do this by preparing swipe copies customized for respective niches, in-house produced videos, handy social media posts, beautifully designed banners, and Facebook promoted post images for you to play with.

             <p class="paragraph-text smaller left wow margin-top-30 fadeInUp">
            <small>We receive large volumes of application weekly.<br> Unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to respond as thoughtfully as we’d like to every applicant.<br>
            However, we can assure you that we read and carefully review every application with the greatest amount of consideration before making our decision, and if we feel your application is the right fit, we’ll generally respond within 7 days and you will receive your login details for our affiliate program via email. If you do not hear from us within 15 days it means your application was unsuccessful.<br>That said, if you further develop your program/site/blog at a later date, we’re always happy to review your application again.</small>
